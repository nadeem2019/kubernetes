Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 10.128.15.219:6443 --token upwzkl.a5v4yzycl4e70gb4 \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:69d01da6e3b29be4165ae0fea5bd87dee9b8c26641fd0cf514e6b8e7930efbec
